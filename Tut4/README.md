Task :
- Assign1, Problem2, Task3 : Implement Logistic Regression on heart.csv. I have loads of problems with this :

Update 11/08 : I managed to complete the task and uploaded it as heart_attempt3(success).py . Turns out the problem isn't with anything else, but that the size of my placeholders weren't set correctly. Do ignore the questions below! (Left it in as documentation)

Questions :

- I implemented it the first time (heart_attempt1.py) by feeding in the data with my own code. The optimizer works, however i realised that the parameters predict every single case as 0! (both on the training set and test set). Is there a problem with my algorithm? Or it is the data that is problematic?

- I tried to implement it a second time (heart_attempt2.py) using the code given by the lecturer (https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials/blob/master/examples/05_csv_reader.py), slightly modified. It gave the exact same result. I'm not sure if it's because I implemented the sigmoid function incorrectly, since this is the first time I'm doing one vs one logistic regression on tensorflow.
